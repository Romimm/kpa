<br> <font size="6"> 1. Soligorsk waste heaps </font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6">  <left>     Someone compares these species with Mars, someone with the desert. There are almost real mountains near Soligorsk. In fact, this is the waste of the extraction of potash fertilizers "Belaruskali — - clay with salt and gypsum, sand. But, thanks to the height of almost 120 meters, it seems that in front of you is a small mountain range. The water around the landfills is a concentrated brine, which is why many people compare it with the water of the Dead Sea. Of course, it can not be considered curative. And the landfills themselves can not be called completely safe: they are located on the territory of technical facilities and are not adapted for mass visits by people. </left>       </font>  </br>

<br> <font size="6"> 2. The only cave in Belarus  </font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6">The karst cave with a depth of 10 meters was formed 25 thousand years ago after the Poozersky glaciation. It is washed in sandstone, so strong-minded people who climb there have a persistent feeling that the walls are about to crumble. The cave entrance is quite narrow, but 3 people can fit inside. It will not be possible to walk under the arches, however, for the residents of Belarus it is an interesting speleological experience.</font>  </br>

<br> <font size="6">3. Round lake near the village of Povitye </font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6"> Near the village of Povitye in the Kobrin district there is a perfectly round reservoir. This man-made reservoir was created in the 90s of the last century to perform a specific task: to "take over" water from nearby reclamation channels.

There are similar objects in the Ivanovo, Berezovsky and Gomel districts. In all cases, the round shape is nothing more than an engineering solution. Although there are still conspiracy theories about the appearance of "circles" on forums: from nuclear tests to testing of the Soviet global navigation satellite system.</font>  </br>

<br> <font size="6">4. National Library</font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6">The Diamond of knowledge-the so-called famous Minsk library for its unusual appearance by local standards-was built in 2006. Francysk Skaryna, the first book printer of Belarus, welcomes you at the entrance to the building. Inside the library, 10 million copies in the form of manuscripts, books, newspapers and other paper media are available to readers and ordinary tourists. After a rest in a cafe right in the heart of the rhombocuboctahedron (this is the name of the unusual figure in the form of which the library is made), visit the observation deck at an altitude of 73 meters to see Minsk at a glance. </font>  </br>

<br> <font size="6">5.The gates of Minsk </font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6"> The twin towers — another iconic landmark of Minsk-can be seen immediately as soon as you exit through the main entrance of the railway station to the street. These are two symmetrical buildings of 11 floors, built in 1952 in the style of Stalinist architecture, decorated with trophy clocks, the coat of arms of the BSSR and marble statues. It was from here that Independence Avenue was supposed to begin. As a rule, this is the first attraction that all visitors take pictures of.</font>  </br>

<br> <font size="6"> 6.Opera and Ballet Theater</font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6">Do you want to know where to go with your family in Minsk and have a cultural rest? This theater is a kind of monopolist from the art world: the only opera theater in Belarus and, at the same time, the largest in the country. Founded in 1933, it occupies the place of honor of an architectural monument and impresses passers-by with snow-white domes and columns every day, and visitors with a symphony orchestra, a children's choir,opera and ballet troupes. </font>  </br>

<br> <font size="6"> 7.Museum of the History of the Great Patriotic War</font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6"> What to see in Minsk to plunge into history? Of course, a museum! The building of an extremely unusual shape for a museum — a domed building with "sun rays" on the edge-opened in 2014 and has already managed to impress more than one tourist. There are 143 thousand exhibits, 10 halls dedicated to different periods of the war, and a real memory square under a glass roof, where the names of battle heroes are inscribed in gold letters. The modern approach to conducting excursions and multimedia equipment of the museum are perfectly combined with the memorabilia of soldiers and found relics. At the entrance to the museum you can see the stele "Minsk-the hero city", and right behind it is the Victory Park and the island of birds.</font>  </br>

<br> <font size="6">8.Victory Square </font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6">Minsk is a storehouse of historical places and attractions, and there is another significant place in the city center. "The feat of the people is immortal" - says the inscription on the houses around Victory Square. In honor of the valiant defense of Soviet soldiers, it was founded: now the eternal flame is burning here and the capsules with the earth of the hero-city, including Moscow, Kiev and many others, are laid. And the houses around the square are known for other reasons: in addition to a couple of cafes, there is an apartment of the same Lee Harvey Oswald. </font>  </br>

<br> <font size="6">9.Gorky Park </font>  </br>
<br> <font size="6"> Don't know where to go with children in Minsk? Gorky Park is the most family-friendly attraction of the city of Minsk. We present to your attention 28 hectares of green spaces, water, metal structures (in the form of attractions and frames of street cafes), stone steps and laughter. Gorky Park has existed since 1805. This is the most cozy place of rest for families and couples in love, meetings of sunsets and sunrises and walks along the embankment, for lovers of the smell of barbecue and popcorn.</font>  </br>
